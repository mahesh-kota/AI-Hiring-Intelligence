# 🚀 AI Hiring Intelligence

AI Hiring Intelligence is a recruiter-grade decision engine that evaluates GitHub developers using engineering signals, activity metrics, and AI to generate hiring recommendations, risk assessments, and actionable improvement insights in seconds.

---

## 🔥 The Problem

GitHub profiles often fail to clearly communicate developer skill, consistency, and real-world readiness.

Recruiters spend hours manually reviewing repositories, commits, and contributions — making hiring slow and inconsistent.

---

## ✅ The Solution

AI Hiring Intelligence transforms GitHub from a passive portfolio into an intelligent hiring decision system.

Instead of just showing data, the platform answers the critical question:

👉 **“Should this developer be shortlisted?”**

---

## ⭐ Core Capabilities

✔ Hireability Score based on engineering signals  
✔ AI Recruiter Evaluation (realistic hiring-style verdict)  
✔ Developer Risk Detection  
✔ Commit Activity Analysis  
✔ Actionable Improvement Recommendations  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Frontend → Analysis Engine → GitHub API → Gemini AI → Hiring Verdict

The system aggregates technical signals and applies AI reasoning to simulate real recruiter decision-making.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- React + Vite  
- TypeScript  
- Google Gemini AI  
- GitHub REST API  

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Most tools analyze GitHub.

**AI Hiring Intelligence makes hiring decisions.**

This shift from analytics → decision intelligence dramatically reduces recruiter effort while improving candidate evaluation quality.
